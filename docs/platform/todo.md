# Laundry list for possible actions

- write a Makefile allowing: `make build astroml`
- install jupyterlab extensions in home directory rather than /opt/conda
- configure jupyterlab containers to automatically creating directories  somewhere less intrusive than just `$HOME`:
 `migrated astropy matplotlib yarn lab pip fontconfig serverconfig jedi numba`
- launcher in jupyterlab has too many launching and confusing icons
- make a button on jupyterlab that will create a new environment automatically and create an icon
- build npm apps on container directories to avoid populating million of useless files
- environments in home directory with pip by default
- add other alternative notebooks such as querybook, cocalc, nteract_on_jupyter
