# Launching Desktop Sessions

Desktop sessions on CANFAR provide a full Linux graphical environment directly in your browser, with access to CANFAR storage. Most astronomy software is launched in dedicated containers on separate worker nodes and connects to your browser session using X11 protocols. This guide explains how to launch and use desktop sessions, including CANFAR-supported and user-contributed astronomy software.

!!! note "Connection Timing"
    Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the session link to work properly. If you see a "Bad gateway" error, wait a moment and try again.

## Connecting to Your Desktop

### Initial Connection

Click the **Connect** button to access your desktop environment.

> ![image](../images/desktop/6_connect_desktop.png)


### Desktop Environment

When you connect, you'll see a full Linux desktop in your browser. Key features include:

- **Taskbar**: Application launcher and system controls
- **File manager**: Browse CANFAR storage and files
- **Terminal**: Command-line access
- **Shortcut icons**: Quick launch for DS9, Aladin, TOPCAT, and Firefox
- **Astro Software menu**: Access CANFAR-supported and user-contributed astronomy containers

Most applications are launched in containers and connect to your desktop session using X11 protocols. Only a few tools are native to the desktop itself.

### Session Persistence

and work remain open.
When your session becomes inactive, you'll be returned to the connection page.
Click **Connect** again to resume exactly where you left off - all your applications
and work remain open.


## Available Software

### Astronomy Applications

The desktop session provides access to astronomy software in two ways:

- **Shortcut icons**: DS9, Aladin, TOPCAT, and Firefox are available directly on the desktop for quick access.
- **Astro Software menu**: Find CANFAR-supported and user-contributed astronomy containers under Applications â†’ Astro Software. These containers run on separate worker nodes and connect to your desktop session.

You can also access other tools and environments, including Python (with AstroPy, Jupyter), CASA, IRAF/PyRAF, and more, depending on the available containers and desktop configuration.

## Working with Applications

### Launching Applications

### Method 1: Astro Software Menu

1. Click the Applications menu in the taskbar
2. Select "Astro Software" to browse CANFAR-supported and user-contributed astronomy containers
3. Choose your desired application to launch it in a dedicated container

### Method 2: Desktop Shortcuts

- Click the shortcut icon for DS9, Aladin, TOPCAT, or Firefox on the main desktop to launch these applications quickly

**Note:** Most astronomy applications are launched in containers and connect to your desktop session. You cannot start a terminal and simply run `ds9 &` or similar commands, as these applications are not installed natively in the desktop environment.

### Method 3: File Association

- Double-click FITS files to open in DS9 (if available)
- Right-click files for "Open with" options

### Example: Multi-Application Workflow

Here's a typical desktop workflow for optical astronomy:

1. **File Management**: Use file manager to organize data
2. **Image Display**: Open FITS files in DS9 for inspection
3. **Analysis**: Launch Python/Jupyter for data analysis
4. **Documentation**: Use text editor for notes and scripts
5. **Results**: Save plots and analysis outputs


### CASA Desktop Usage

To use CASA with its graphical interface, launch it from the Astro Software menu. CASA runs in a dedicated container and connects to your desktop session, allowing access to its full plotting and visualisation tools.

## Desktop Session Tips

### Copy & Paste Between Containers

Since different containers (e.g., CASA and terminal windows) in a desktop session may run on different remote computers, copying and pasting text between containers requires using the **Clipboard** application.

#### Accessing the Clipboard

1. **Open the Clipboard**: Click the arrow at the far left of the desktop to open the application menu
2. **Find Clipboard**: Look for "Clipboard" in the middle of the application list and click it

> ![Desktop with Clipboard Menu](../images/clipboard/2_desktop_with_clipboard_menu.png)

#### Using the Clipboard

The Clipboard serves as an intermediary for transferring text between containers:

1. **Copy text**: Highlight text in the source container and use `Ctrl+Shift+C`
2. **Transfer via Clipboard**: The text should appear in the Clipboard application
3. **Select in Clipboard**: Highlight the text in the Clipboard and press `Ctrl+Shift+C`
4. **Paste to target**: Click in the destination container and use `Ctrl+Shift+V`

> ![Copying Text Between Containers](../images/clipboard/4_text_into_clipboard.png)

!!! tip "Keyboard Shortcuts"
    - **Copy**: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
    - **Paste**: `Ctrl+Shift+V`
    - These shortcuts work consistently across all desktop containers

### Adjusting Font Size

Desktop containers support adjustable font sizes for better readability:

#### Changing Terminal Font Size

1. **Access font menu**: Hold `Ctrl` and right-click anywhere in a terminal window
2. **Select size**: Choose from the available font size options (Small, Medium, Large)
3. **Apply immediately**: Font changes take effect instantly

> ![Font Size Adjustment](../images/font/2_fontsize_popup.png)

This feature works in:
- Terminal windows
- CASA command-line interface
- Text-based applications

!!! note "Font Persistence"
    Font size changes apply only to the current session. You'll need to readjust when starting new sessions.

## File Management

### Storage Access

Your desktop session provides access to:

- **`/arc/projects/[projectname]/`**: Shared project storage
- **`/arc/home/[username]/`**: Personal persistent storage
- **`/scratch/`**: Temporary scratch space, unique to each application.

!!! warning "Persistence Reminder"
    Use `/arc/projects/` or `/arc/home/` for important files. `/scratch` and `/tmp/` will not persist after the session ends.

### File Operations

Use the graphical file manager for:

- **Drag-and-drop**: Move files between directories
- **Visual browsing**: Preview images and data files
- **Batch operations**: Select multiple files for operations
- **Permissions**: Set file and directory permissions


### Ending Sessions

To properly end your desktop session:

1. **Save all work**: Ensure data is saved to persistent storage
2. **Close applications**: Exit programs cleanly
3. **Disconnect**: Close the browser tab
4. **Delete session**: Use Science Portal to free resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Session won't connect

- Wait 30 seconds and try again
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
